# QMLHEP GSoC 2025 Tasks

This repository contains my solutions to the evaluation tasks for the QML-HEP GSoC 2025 program.

I am mainly applying for the [**Equivariant quantum neural networks for High Energy Physics Analysis at the LHC**](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/2025/proposal_QMLHEP4.html) project. I'm particularly interested in this project because of the opportunity to implement and test equivariant quantum models with HEP datasets, and benchmark their performance against classical and non-equivariant models.

## Project Interest and Background

My interest lies in Machine Learning for Science activities, specifically:

*    [**Equivariant quantum neural networks for High Energy Physics Analysis at the LHC**](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/2025/proposal_QMLHEP4.html)

**Project Description:**

The ambitious HL-LHC program will require enormous computing resources in the next two decades. New technologies are being sought after to replace the present computing infrastructure. A burning question is whether a quantum computer can solve the ever-growing demand of computing resources in High Energy Physics (HEP) in general and physics at LHC in particular. Discovery of new physics requires the identification of rare signals against immense backgrounds. Developing machine learning methods will greatly enhance our ability to achieve this objective. With this project, we seek to implement Quantum Machine Learning (QML) methods for LHC HEP analysis based on some QML frameworks (PennyLane, Cirq, Bloqade, â€¦). This will enhance the ability of the HEP community to use QML methods.

**Task Ideas**

*   Implement an equivariant quantum neural network.
*   Test the equivariant quantum model with HEP datasets
*   Benchmark the trained model and compare it against classical and non-equivariant models.

**Expected results**

Trained equivariant quantum neural networks with a QML framework (PennyLane, Cirq, Bloqade, etc.).
Benchmark of the performance against a non-equivariant model

## Other Projects

While I am primarily interested in the Equivariant QNN project, I am open to working on other projects if they align well with my skills and the needs of the QML-HEP program. I am committed to contributing to the best of my ability, regardless of the specific project.
